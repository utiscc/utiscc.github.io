# Welcome to utis.cc

This site is meant for hosting [UTIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Type_Identifier) that are not specific to one application or developer but shared among many apps, and therefore considered "open source".

The domain `utis.cc` has been reserved for this purpose (currently paid until July 2026).

If you're a developer and like to register a shared UTI, please contact us via the [Issues tracker](https://github.com/utiscc/utiscc.github.io/issues).

## Currently known shared UTIs

- [POSIX Paths File](https://github.com/utiscc/DotPathsFileSpec) for storing and exchanging lists of file references.
- [Pasteboard Types](http://nspasteboard.org) for clipboard tools (`org.nspasteboard.TransientType`, `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType`, `org.nspasteboard.AutoGeneratedType`, `org.nspasteboard.source`).
